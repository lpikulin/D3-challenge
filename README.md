# D3-challenge
Several issues with this assignment:
1). The first time you try to change an axis, it doesn't work properly.  Any change after the first change does work appropriately.
2). The tool tips never update to reflect a new axis. 

I suspect this has something to do with retaining the value of ChosenXaxis and ChosenYaxis, but I can't figure out where it's not being retained.
